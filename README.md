# Joystick-Shifter
## Software solution to use a joystick as an H-pattern shifter


This will allow not only for different positions of the joystick to act as different gears, but for those gears to be held in even after you release the joystick.  
  (i.e you move the joystick up and left, gear 1 will be selected; when you let go of the joystick, gear 1 will remain selected and it won't go right back to neutral.)

The software has two modes: vJoy mode (requires vJoy to be installed) and keyboard mode.  
vJoy mode can be used if a game does not support mapping keyboard keys as gears (e.g. Assetto Corsa)  
or for certain games where keyboard input will cause a conflict or not function properly (e.g. Forza Horizon 4, GIMX).

Please note that the software is in an alpha state and not user-friendly yet. I have full intention to make sure it is user-friendly and is as simple to use as can be. 
I am sharing this project earlier only because it is functional, 
and because I wished it existed when I had to figure out how to get a similar solution working using 2 or 3 programs back when I only had a Driving Force GT. 
It may contain bugs as well.  
It will be improved upon.

You can let me know what your thoughts of this project are.
